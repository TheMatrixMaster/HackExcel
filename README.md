# HackExcel
THE ISSUE Whether you're keeping track of inventory, documenting employee payroll or creating a new budget, processing large and complex Excel files to extract key information can be extremely tiresome and time consuming. Manually parsing and renaming each data column is quite a sub-optimal method and is often prone to errors that can bias your valuable data. OUR MAGIC SOLUTION HackExcel is a user-friendly and customizable tool that performs efficient and reliable transformations to Excel and CSV files. Using a list of keywords inputted by the user, HackExcel determines the data columns that need to be parsed and reformatted in the output file. This scalable solution allows users to track the data they want to keep without losing control of the desired output format.
